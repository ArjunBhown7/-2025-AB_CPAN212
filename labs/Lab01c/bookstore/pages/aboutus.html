        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 1999, Book Haven began as a small local bookstore in the heart of Novel City, Fictionland. 
            With a passion for literature and a vision to bring books closer to everyone, we’ve grown into one of the most beloved bookstores in the country.
            We offer a wide range of books, from timeless classics to the latest bestsellers, catering to readers of all ages and tastes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, Book Haven has been more than just a bookstore; it has become a community hub where book lovers can come together, attend events, and explore the joy of reading.
            Our mission is simple: to foster a love for reading by making books accessible, affordable, and enjoyable for everyone.
